## Introduction

AI-Medical-Chatbot is an innovative, AI-powered medical chatbot designed to assist users in receiving personalized healthcare advice. By collecting basic health data, such as blood pressure (BP), blood type, and genotype, the chatbot analyzes this information through a pre-trained AI model. The result is a detailed recommendation that advises whether the user needs medical attention or can follow self-care procedures. This chatbot aims to bridge the gap between individuals and their healthcare providers, offering fast, reliable medical insights directly to users.

## Features

- **Secure User Authentication**: Users can sign up or log in with secure authentication, ensuring data privacy and user-specific access.
- **Health Data Collection**: Users input health metrics such as BP, blood type, genotype, etc., which are essential for AI analysis.
- **AI-Driven Diagnosis**: The chatbot processes the user’s data and uses AI models to predict potential health concerns or suggest self-care options.
- **Real-Time Medical Recommendations**: Immediate recommendations based on user inputs, whether medical attention is required or self-treatment is adequate.
- **Data Storage and History**: Users’ health data is stored securely in a database for future reference, enabling consistent health monitoring.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A clean, responsive user interface that ensures seamless navigation from signup to receiving personalized health advice.

## System Architecture

The architecture of AI-Medical-Chatbot is divided into three major components:
1. **Frontend**: A responsive user interface built with React for data input, user interaction, and displaying AI recommendations.
2. **Backend**: Node.js and Express handle user authentication, database interaction, and communication with the AI model.
3. **AI Model**: A machine learning model that processes user inputs and generates predictions based on the provided health data.

Below is a high-level system flow:

1. **Landing Page**: Users land on the homepage, with options to either sign up or log in.
2. **Authentication**: Upon successful login, users are authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure session handling.
3. **Health Data Input**: Users input essential health information which is sent to the backend.
4. **AI Processing**: The backend communicates with the AI model, which processes the user’s health data and generates a personalized health prediction.
5. **Recommendation Page**: The AI prediction is sent back to the user, with recommendations for medical care or self-treatment.

## Roadmap

1. **Landing Page**: Simple interface allowing users to sign up or log in.
2. **Sign Up/Login**: New users can register, while existing users log in. After authentication, users are directed to the dashboard.
3. **Dashboard**: The user inputs basic health data such as blood pressure (BP), blood type, and genotype.
4. **AI Prediction**: The backend processes user inputs, and the AI model predicts whether medical attention is required or self-care is sufficient.
5. **Recommendation Display**: The AI’s output is displayed on a new page, outlining potential health risks and recommended actions.
6. **Data Storage**: User data is securely stored in the database for future reference, allowing users to track their health history over time.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **React**: Used for creating a responsive and dynamic user interface.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the web pages.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity on the client-side.

### Backend:
- **Node.js**: Handles server-side operations, routes, and API calls.
- **Express.js**: A lightweight framework for building backend APIs.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database used for storing user data and health information.

### AI Model:
- **Python**: For training the AI model.
- **TensorFlow** or **scikit-learn**: Machine learning frameworks used for building and training the prediction model.

### Other Tools:
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used for secure authentication and authorization.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure that the following are installed on your local machine:

- **Node.js** (v14 or higher)
- **Python 3.8** (for AI model training)
- **MongoDB** (local instance or cloud-based)

### Steps to Install

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-medical-chatbot.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   ```bash
   cd ai-medical-chatbot
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Install Frontend Dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm install
   ```

5. **Set Up Environment Variables**
   Create a `.env` file in the root of the project to configure the following:
   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_uri
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   AI_MODEL_PATH=path_to_your_ai_model
   ```

6. **Run the Backend Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

7. **Run the Frontend**
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm start
   ```

The app will be running locally at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Navigate to the homepage and either sign up or log in.
2. Once logged in, input your health data (e.g., BP, blood type, etc.).
3. The AI will process your data and present a recommendation on the next page.
4. Your health data will be stored for future use, and you can track your health progress over time.

## AI Model

The AI model integrated into the system is built using Python and trained on a healthcare dataset. The model uses various algorithms to predict whether medical attention is needed based on the user’s health data. It runs in the backend and communicates with the frontend through API calls.

**Model Overview:**
- **Training Data**: A healthcare dataset with various health metrics.
- **Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Neural Networks (as applicable).
- **Accuracy**: The model has been trained to an accuracy level of 85-90% (this may vary depending on dataset quality).
